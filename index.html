            <p>
                Network Charter School is a public school chartered by the Eugene 4J School District in 2003. Admission
                is free of charge and open to all Lane County students in grades 7 through 12, regardless of their resident
                school district.
            </p>
 
            <p>    
                If you are looking for a truly unique and stimulating environment, NCS might be the right choice for
                you. Our classes are small, enabling our teachers to provide students with a great deal of individual
                attention and more personalized work than is possible in a conventional classroom.
            </p>
 
            <p>
                We offer a hands-on environment that provides students with an experiential education, incorporating
                both academic excellence and practical skills. We have students from many surrounding school districts
                and provide a bus pass to help with transportation.
            </p>
