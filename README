Setup:

1) Install Composer:

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

2) Run composer to install Twig, etc.

php composer.phar install

Basic functionality:

1) All content comes from static .html files each of which is a twig template inheriting from master.html. To add a new page create a new .html file, have it inherit from master.html and put it in the templates directory. See any file in that directory for examples.

2) The menu is generated as per menu.php. To add a new page to the new or reorgainize the menu edit this file.


3) The CSS in template.css is modified by css crush. That tool adds vendor prefixes, fixes for known browser bugs, etc. You therefore do not need to worry about these issues - just write standard CSS3 and let CSS Crush do the rest. IMPORTANT: this means you should always edit template.css *not* template.crush.css as the later is automatically generated from the former.

Vagrant

There is a Vagrantfile in this directory. If you have Vagrant installed and
configured you can run "vagrant up" to start a virtual machine that will serve
the content in this directory on localhost:8080.
